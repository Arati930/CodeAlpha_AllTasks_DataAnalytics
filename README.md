## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 📌 Task 1: Web Scraping
- Scraped book titles and prices from **Books to Scrape** website using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- Created a custom dataset (`scraped_books.csv`) for analysis.
- 📌 **Learning:** Hands-on experience in navigating HTML structure and extracting data.

---

### 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dataset: **Titanic (Seaborn built-in)**  
- Steps Performed:
  - Checked dataset structure, missing values, and duplicates.
  - Generated statistical summary and correlation matrix (numeric columns).
- 📌 **Key Insights:**
  - Higher survival rate for females.
  - First-class passengers had better chances of survival.
  - Fare showed moderate correlation with survival.

---

### 📉 Task 3: Data Visualization
- Visualized Titanic dataset using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Histogram: Age distribution.
  - Countplot: Survival by class.
  - Heatmap: Feature correlations.
  - Pairplot: Age, Fare, and Survival.
- 📌 **Impact:** Clear storytelling through visuals made insights easier to understand.

### 💬 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
- Dataset: **IMDB Movie Reviews (from NLTK corpus)**  
- Steps Performed:
  - Loaded 2000 labeled reviews (1000 positive, 1000 negative).
  - Applied **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** for sentiment scoring.
  - Compared predicted sentiments with actual labels.
  - Visualized sentiment distribution with bar charts.
- 📌 **Key Insights:**
  - VADER works well for general polarity detection.
  - Neutral predictions appeared in some cases where reviews were mixed.
